        Have you ever traveled to a new country and spent countless hours preparing for the trip? Have you ever 
        gotten to that country and realized that, even with those hours of research, you were unprepared for 
        something? Figuring out the type of currency you need, visas, vaccines, electrical adapters, etc. can 
        be so time-consuming and arduous! 
      </p>
      <p>  
        The Global Traveler Tool allows you to get the critical info you need 
        about the countries you are traveling to all in one place in the blink of an eye. Users can search 
        countries one by one or create custom itineraries with any number of countries and get essential 
        information in a concise and direct form to ensure their international travel, no matter how complex, 
        will go smoothly.
